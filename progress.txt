# Nexa Fund – Development Progress

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Production-ready MVP with blockchain integration

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Platform (Completed)

### Backend Infrastructure
- Express.js + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database (migrated to Neon Cloud)
- JWT authentication with bcrypt
- CORS, rate limiting, helmet security
- File uploads with multer (server-side storage)
- 30+ REST API endpoints

### Frontend Foundation
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- React Query for state management
- Centralized API configuration
- Responsive design system

### Database Schema
- 9 models: User, Campaign, Milestone, Contribution, Vote, Report, Update, Permission, RolePermission
- Advanced relationships with proper foreign keys
- Migration system with Prisma

**Issue Resolved:** Port conflict (backend moved from 5000→5050, PostgreSQL on 5000)

---

## ✅ Phase 2: User Management & RBAC (Completed)

### Role-Based Access Control
- 6-tier hierarchy: SUPER_ADMIN → ADMIN → MODERATOR → CREATOR → BACKER → USER
- 32+ permissions across 8 categories
- Auto-role progression (USER→BACKER→CREATOR)
- User status system (ACTIVE, SUSPENDED, BANNED, PENDING_VERIFICATION)

### Permission System
- `permissionService.ts`: hasPermission, grantPermission, updateUserRole
- Enhanced auth middleware: requireRole, requirePermission, requireOwnership
- Database initialization scripts for roles/permissions

**Issue Resolved:** TypeScript compilation errors in permission system

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Campaign System (Completed)

### Core Features
- Full CRUD with ownership validation
- Reward tiers (dynamic creation/editing)
- Milestone system (voting, tracking)
- Campaign updates (creator communication)
- Media gallery with lightbox
- Status-based security (only ACTIVE campaigns can be backed)

### Admin Panel
- Dashboard with statistics

- User management (roles, verification, suspension)
- Smart context-aware navigation

### UI/UX
- Browse page with filtering
- Campaign details with tabs (Story, Milestones, Updates, Backers, Rewards)
- Profile & Dashboard with activity tracking
- Backer analytics with tier badges

**Issues Resolved:**

- Image loading (localStorage→server)
- Navigation context loss
- CORS & Helmet conflicts

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Blockchain Integration (Completed)

### Smart Contracts (Solidity 0.8.24)
- `NexaFundWeighted.sol`: Milestone-based escrow with weighted voting
- `MilestoneEscrow.sol`: Fund release management
- Deployed to **Tenderly VTN** (Chain ID: 73571)
- Contract address: `0xaB37c74fD8598CF891990Ad69E84D94014AE8Aa9`

### Network Configuration
- Tenderly Virtual TestNet (VTN)
- RPC: `https://virtual.rpc.tenderly.co/TRK/project/public/nexa-vtn`
- Native currency: POL (not ETH)
- Auto-add network to MetaMask

### Features
- Escrow system (contributions locked in contract)
- Milestone-based fund release (60% approval, 10% quorum)
- Weighted voting by contribution amount
- Admin controls (cancel, refund, emergency release)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Ethers.js v5/v6 version conflicts
- Buffer polyfill for Vite
- Network switching in MetaMask

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Recommendation System (In Progress)

### Preference System
- User interest selection (13 categories)
- Backend preference storage API
- Database schema with UserPreference model
- Migration: `20251013_add_user_preferences`

**Issue Resolved:** Authentication middleware integration

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Performance Optimization (Completed - Oct 14)

### Database Optimization
- Added 5 performance indexes on Campaign table (status, category, creatorId, createdAt, compound)
- Query logging optimized (disabled verbose logs, added slow query monitoring >100ms)
- Lazy loading for milestones/rewards (separate endpoints)

### Backend Query Optimization
- `getAllCampaigns`: Parallel queries with Promise.all, explicit field selection
- `getCampaignById`: Removed full milestone/reward loading, return counts only
- Created `/api/campaigns/:id/rewards` and `/api/campaigns/:id/milestones` endpoints

### Frontend Caching
- React Query: 2min staleTime, 10min gcTime
- No refetch on window focus/mount
- Lazy loading for rewards tab

### Results
- Browse page: **1.5-2s → 0.5-0.8s** (60-70% faster)
- Campaign details: **1-1.5s → 0.3-0.6s** (60-75% faster)
- Query logging overhead eliminated (50-120ms saved)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Buffer warning (ethers.js in Vite)
- React Router future flags warnings
- Neon PostgreSQL latency multiplied by query count

---

# ===== Blockchain (Smart Contracts) – Today’s Work =====

Contracts live in `smart-contracts` (Hardhat + ethers v6).

What we added today
- Scripts: `scripts/smoke_weighted.ts` for quick local smoke test
- Tests: `test/NexaFundWeighted.spec.ts`, `test/MilestoneEscrow.spec.ts`
- README: Added a full “Smart Contracts” section with local dev, deploy, REPL, and common pitfalls
- left at.txt: Updated checkpoint with exact commands and troubleshooting

How to run locally (PowerShell)
1) Start node (Terminal A)
   cd "Nexa-Fund\\smart-contracts"
   npx hardhat node

2) Deploy (Terminal B)
   cd "Nexa-Fund\\smart-contracts"
   npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy_weighted.ts

3) Console (Terminal B)
   npx hardhat console --network localhost
   // Then in the console paste one line at a time:
   const addr = "0x...";
   await ethers.provider.getCode(addr)
   const [admin, b1, b2] = await ethers.getSigners();
   const c = await ethers.getContractAt("NexaFundWeighted", addr);
   await c.connect(b1).contribute({ value: ethers.parseEther("3.0") });
   await c.connect(b2).contribute({ value: ethers.parseEther("1.0") });
   let nowTs = (await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest")).timestamp;
   let startTs = BigInt(nowTs) + 120n; let endTs = startTs + 3600n;
   await c.openVoting(0, startTs, endTs);
   await network.provider.send("evm_setNextBlockTimestamp", [Number(startTs + 1n)]); await network.provider.send("evm_mine");
   await c.connect(b1).voteMilestone(0, true);
   (await c.getMilestone(0))[2]

Automated tests
   cd "Nexa-Fund\\smart-contracts"
   npm install
   npx hardhat test
   // Expect: 2 passing (MilestoneEscrow + NexaFundWeighted)

Troubleshooting
- BAD_WINDOW → choose a start time strictly in the future (add 60–600s)
- NOT_IN_WINDOW → advance chain time with evm_setNextBlockTimestamp + evm_mine
- INSUFFICIENT → top-up with contribute() so balance >= milestone amount
- EADDRINUSE on npx hardhat node → a node is already running on 8545; reuse it or kill the PID
