## üìã Business Rules

### Weighted Voting
- **Vote Power** = Sum of all user contributions to campaign
- **Release Conditions:**
  - Approval: YES votes ‚â• 60% of total voting power
  - Quorum: Total votes ‚â• 10% of campaign goal
- **Both conditions** must be met for release

### Milestone Status Flow
```
PENDING ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí VOTING ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED
         (backers) (creator)   (7 days)  (funds released)
          fund      submits     backers   or milestone
                    proof       vote      fails
```

### Validation Rules
1. Only backers (with contributions) can vote
2. Cannot vote twice on same milestone
3. Voting only during 7-day window
4. Creator must own campaign to submit
5. Admin role required for manual triggers

---

## üïí Automated System

### Cron Job
- **Schedule:** Every hour at minute 0
- **Action:** Checks all VOTING milestones with expired voteEndTime
- **If Release Conditions Met:**
  - Calls smart contract finalize()
  - Updates status to APPROVED
  - Sets next milestone to ACTIVE
- **If Conditions Not Met:**
  - Updates status to REJECTED
  - Does NOT release funds

### Manual Trigger
Admin can force immediate check using:
```http
POST /milestones/admin/trigger-release-check
```
